#  Urban Development & Real Estate Insights
### Data-Driven Analysis for Smarter Urban Planning & Investment Decisions

An end-to-end **data analytics and modeling project** that transforms raw urban and real-estate data into **actionable insights** for urban planners, investors, and policy makers.

---

##  Why This Project Matters

Urban development decisions influence **economic growth, infrastructure planning, sustainability, and real estate investment** at a global scale.

This project demonstrates:
- Strong **analytical thinking**
- Ability to work with **real-world, messy datasets**
- Translation of data insights into **business and policy impact**

Designed to reflect how **top-tier companies** expect data projects to be structured and communicated.

##  Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handled missing values using context-aware techniques  
- Removed inconsistencies and extreme outliers  
- Standardized and normalized numerical features  

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed spatial and temporal pricing trends  
- Identified correlations between infrastructure growth and property value  
- Visualized regional development patterns  

### 3️⃣ Feature Engineering
- Created derived metrics such as:
  - Urban growth intensity
  - Development velocity
  - Price per infrastructure unit  

### 4️⃣ Modeling (Where Applicable)
- Applied regression and ML techniques to:
  - Forecast property prices
  - Identify high-potential urban regions  
- Evaluated models using appropriate performance metrics
